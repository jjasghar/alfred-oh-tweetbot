# alfred-oh-tweetbot

This [alfred](http://alfredapp.com) workflow has two commands to run. `oh` and `ohyolo`.

If you don't know, "OH, an abbreviation commonly used on Twitter which stands for 'overheard'".

With `oh` the command takes an argument and pastes in the argument to a new tweet with [tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/). It pre-pends "OH: " so you can just verify that it's something you'd like to "OH."

On the other hand `ohyolo` takes what you write after and auto-tweets it out via tweetbot. Like the kids say, [#yolo](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yolo).

If you have any suggestion or thoughts don't hesitate to open an issue and we can make this better!

Thanks to:

1. Joshua Timberman, for giving me this idea.
